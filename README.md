# Decision-Game
Team Giraffe's decsion game project for Software Engineering I.

3/3/20: I've reorganized the files so that this README can be updated according to recent pushes/commits. The main.dart file was also uploaded and should be shown above this file

In changes to the main.dart file, i've added the navigation to the second screen and a text field. The classes/states have been created for all the screens, they only need re-formatting.

3/23/20: [Forked a new branch to my GitHub and on my local machine, This is just a little addition in order to create the new branch.

17:15 This is a test to see if commit signing is working correctly.


19:20 Added project dependent files so future pull requests or clones can be imported directly into Android Studio or VSCode without need to copy code from GitHub and create a new project.

21:13 Still very unfamilliar with Flutter and Dart, added a basic action button so I can work on implementing user functionality to enter multiple outcomes. Aiming to get started on that tommorow.]
